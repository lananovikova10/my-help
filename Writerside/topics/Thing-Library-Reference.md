# Thing Library Reference

## Overview

The "Thing" library is a Python-based neural vision system designed to optimize spatial organization in dynamic environments such as cafes and restaurants.

## Installation

[](hellp.md)

```tex
\begin{equation}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}
```

```python
pip install thing-library
```

## Importing the Library

```python
from thing import Thing
```
from thing import Thing
## Class: Thing

### Initialization
```python
thing = Thing(environment='cafe')
```

- environment (str): Specifies the type of environment (e.g., 'cafe', 'restaurant').

### Methods

<deflist>
<def title="configure">

Configures the system for the specific environment.

```python
thing.configure(settings)
```

- `settings (dict)`: Dictionary containing configuration settings.

</def>
<def title="train">

Trains the system to adapt to the environment.

```python
thing.train(data)
```

- `data (list)`: List of training data specific to the environment.

</def>
<def title="analyze">

Analyzes the current spatial layout and provides guidelines.

```python
guidelines = thing.analyze(image)
```

- `image (str or numpy array)`: Path to the image file or an image array of the current layout.
